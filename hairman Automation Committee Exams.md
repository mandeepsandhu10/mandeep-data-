Chairman Automation Committee (Exams)

The following things need to be automated for the smooth functioning of Examinations:

1.	M. Tech. Thesis result notification and PHD notification should be automated.

2.	Gazette should be generated and uploaded on the website automatically.

3.	The name and other details of the non on roll students should be visible.

4.	Current session results should be visible in the exam portal, with grades as well as awards.

5.	Examination Branch should be able to issue Confidential Results after the availability of awards and before the declaration of provisional result.

6.	Studentâ€™s summary should be visible in the exam portal.

7.	Result data semester wise in the format that we used to send to PTU should be made   visible session wise. Also, student wise details of results should be made available.

8.	Issue and correction forms available at https://gndec.ac.in/?q=node/85 should be automated. i.e. should be able to apply from his portal, and students need to write his concern only, next related data must be shown as read only to the student. Then the form must be processed by department online filled, either sent back to the student or sent to the Examination Branch for further processing. If the examination branch finds it Ok, then its PDF must be downloaded, else be sent back with
remarks. All this done as a workflow from the portal.

9.	PTU results available at ptudocs should be automatically downloaded and a link should be generated where all the PTU result notifications can be seen and that link could be provided in all the departments for verification of results.
