Dear Madam,

It is brought into your kind notice that an amount of Rs.11100/- was credited into your account by mistake (related with question paper uploading duty in examination branch). The said amount was actually meant for Dr. Rajvir Kaur (AP, Chemistry App. Sci. deptt.).

It is therefore requested that you kindly give your consent to withdraw this amount from your account and transfer the same in account of Dr. Rajvir Kaur (Chemistry).


Kindly send your written consent at the earliest to the undersigned.
