Principal

We have received the request from students to consider conducted detainee exam score into the result declaration (application enclosed). Due to Covid-19 pandemic, the students were provisionally allowed to appear in the exam but later on, upon record verification it was found that the students were detained in the concerned subjects. So, the result cannot be processed unless they clear the detention in the concerned subjects. Also, the conducted examination stands cancelled and they have to retake the exam in the next session and as such we cannot entertain request of student.
