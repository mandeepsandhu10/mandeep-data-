Subject: Result of Chemistry

After the declaration of result, a lot of complaints / requested are hereby received to recheck / re-conduct of examination. Majority of requests are for chemistry subject as result is very poor. Failure rate is more than 58% on getting such large requests. We got 5 random sheets of failing students rechecked and find all file got upward revision in the range of 71% to 217%. This suggest that we need get all sheets of failing students rechecked.

If above is approved, you are requested to allow rechecking by issuing sheets to examiner to utilize three off days, as there is pressing time constraint to start the examination of current semester and for that we need to declare result of previous semester. For this we also need to open exam branch on 12-06-2021 to prepare the sheets for rechecking purpose.
