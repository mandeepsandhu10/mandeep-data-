Subject: Permission to withdraw the revaluation and answer sheet display process due to Covid19 for ESE Nov-2020 online and offline.

Respected Sir,

As per the previous practice the Students are shown their answer sheets at the end of the examination after evaluation and in case of any discrepancy then can they fill re-evaluation form (DRF) after paying requisite fee and answer sheets are re-evaluated.


Keeping in view the current situation due to COVID19, it may be allowed to withdraw this process (revaluation and answer sheet display) for this session Nov-2020.
