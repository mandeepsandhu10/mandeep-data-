Subject: Regarding pattern of question papers and PG for regular and reappear ESE Jun 2020 (Online mode)

Sir,

The ESE Jun 2020 session will be conducted through e- proctored online mode on third party platform (Hiremee) in four different seasons as decided in the Board of examiners meeting. Season-1 will be regular examination of 7,8 semester students, season-2 will be makeup examination (NOV-2019), Season-3 will be reappear examination of 2011-2017 scheme and season-4 will be for 2018-2019 scheme students. Initially it was decided that only regular examination of 7,8 sem of B.Tech. will be conducted
through online mode and the question paper pattern of UG was approved having 40 questions of 1 mark each and 10 questions of 2 marks each (reference letter- SS/24/281, dated: 19/05/2020). Now, decision has been taken to conduct reappear examination of PG also. So kindly allow to use the same question paper pattern (as is for UG) for reappear PG examination also. The marks obtained out of 60 will be scaled out 100 for this examination. Keeping in mind the urgency of the situation, kindly approve the question paper pattern of UG for PG examination as early as possible.
