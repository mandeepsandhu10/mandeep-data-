Subject: Permission to evaluate the answer sheet from External due to non-availability of internal evaluator.

Respected Sir,

This is to bring to your kind notice that there are some sheets of English subject of Applied Science and BCA of ESE Nov-2020 which has not been evaluated yet. These were allotted to Pf. Puneet Narang, AP (App. Sci.) and she is on leave due to health issues. Another teacher of English Pf. Amandeep Singh Bal is living in containment zone (Dugri, Ludhiana).

So, due to shortage of time we need to arrange an external examiner to complete the evaluation process. You are requested to allow us for the same.
