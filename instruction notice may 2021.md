ALL HOD's

Questions whose answers are in the writing form should be attempted on A4 sheet. All the drawing questions should be attempted on A0 size sheet.

Make single pdf file contains [A4 sheets (written) +question wise pdf file (drawing) +full screenshot of A0 sheet]

Divide the drawing area into margins such that in one margin one drawing question can be completely attempted and complete margin (containing one complete drawing question) can be captured by your mobile camera easily.

Therefore, if you have done one theoretical question on 2 normal A4 sheets, five drawing questions bin five separate margins, then total number of pages will be 2(for A4 sheets)+ 5 (for 4 drawing questions)+ 1 for full A0 drawing sheet=8
