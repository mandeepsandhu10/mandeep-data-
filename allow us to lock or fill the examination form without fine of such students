However some students got their forms unlocked, by mistake, and thus they did not lock/fill it again, which was mandatory. So, as such this form is considered as not filled and students are not eligible to appear in exam. For such cases, you are requested to allow us to lock the form without any fine for only those students who have already paid the reappear examination fees.
